## Lab 1: 8-Puzzle with A* Algorithm

This is an implementation of an 8-puzzle solution algorithm using Python created for the *Introduction to AI and Data Science* course at the FH Campus Wien.

The program creates a desired number of random 8-puzzles and solves them using Hamming and Manhattan distances as heuristics,
as well as calculates the memory usage (number of expanded nodes) and computation time of each heuristic.
